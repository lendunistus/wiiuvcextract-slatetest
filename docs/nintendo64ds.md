### Downloads

* [Dumpling](https://github.com/emiyl/dumpling/releases/latest/) (download ``dumpling.zip``)

#### Steps

**1.** Extract the contents of ``dumpling.zip`` to the root of your SD card.

**2.** Insert your USB storage device or SD card into your Wii U.

**3.** If prompted, **do not** format any USB devices through the Wii U.

**4.** Launch the internet browser on your console and open `dumplingapp.com`.

**5.** Tap "Launch dumpling". <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If your console freezes for more than 10 seconds, hold down the Power button for 4 seconds and reboot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Once rebooted, [reset the browser's save data](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1507/~/how-to-delete-the-internet-browser-history) and try again.

**5.** Select "Dump Digital Games".

**6.** Select all the games you want to dump using the DPad/A button and then press Start.

**7.** Make sure the target destination is set to ``SD card`` and the account is set accordingly, then select Start to begin dumping. (this could take a while)

**8.** Once the dump has finished, press Start to exit Dumpling and insert your SD card into your computer/phone.

**9. If you're extracting an N64 game:** Go into dumpling/games/[name of the game you dumped]/content/rom/ on your SD card. There should be a single file in that folder. Change its extension to ``.z64``.

**If you're extracting a DS game:** Go into dumpling/games/[name of the game you dumped]/game/content/0010/ on your SD card. There should be a file called ``rom.zip`` that should contain a ``.nds`` or a ``.srl`` file inside it. If it is an ``.srl`` file, change the extension to ``.nds``.

**10.** Copy the file to a safe location on your device.
