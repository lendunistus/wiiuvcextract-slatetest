**9. If you're extracting an N64 game:** Go into dumpling/games/[name of the game you dumped]/content/rom/ on your SD card. There should be a single file in that folder. Change its extension to ``.z64``.

**If you're extracting a DS game:** Go into dumpling/games/[name of the game you dumped]/game/content/0010/ on your SD card. There should be a file called ``rom.zip`` that should contain a ``.nds`` or a ``.srl`` file inside it. If it is an ``.srl`` file, change the extension to ``.nds``.
